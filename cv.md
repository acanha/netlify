## Summary

I have done mostly (web) application development for past few years, mainly in C# and NodeJS (as it
suited best for my tasks). Some of them were part of larger application I helped to design.

Successively I decided to move to the front end dark side as well, wishing (and succeeding) to become
a full stack developer, focusing on what I call the backend of the frontend. I'm particularly
interested in **user interfaces** and **Web APIs**

My long-term interest include project management (especially of small teams), pragmatic programming,
distributed software environments, collaborative editing, publishing and [speaking](/talks).

## Work Experience

### [StopLight](https://stoplight.io)
#### API Design, Docs, Mocking, and Testing
##### Software developer - **Oct 2018 - Current**

- In charge of [Prism](https://stoplight.io/prism), an Open Source and feature complete OAS2/3 mock server

### [LunchBadger](https://lunchbadger.com)
#### Complete API Lifecycle, Orchestration and Optimization
##### Software developer - **Sep 2017 - Sep 2018**

- Mainteiner and contributor of [Express Gateway](https://express-gateway.io) project, the first
API Gateway written in Javascript running on NodeJS. In particular I've been working on the its code,
its promotion by [writing](https://auth0.com/blog/apigateway-microservices-superglue/)
[multiple](https://auth0.com/blog/application-metrics-with-express-gateway/) [articles](https://auth0.com/blog/keep-api-backward-compatibility-with-express-gateway/), spreading the people to use it
and providing support on multiple channels (Gitter, Google Groups). I've also spoke at multiple conference
about the project itself.

- Advising and working on LunchBadger product. This includes the general architecture, integrating Express Gateway in the solution, employing Kubernetes and a lot of other tools in the ecosystem (such as Helm, VaultProject, Consul).

### [Apiary.io - Acquired by Oracle](http://apiary.io)
#### API Design Stack as Service
##### Software developer - **Oct 2014 - Jul 2017**

I've been working as a Full Stack software engineer (with a strong Frontend attitude) and leading
the Documentation Team (basically the squad behind the generated documentations, such
as [this one](http://docs.onenote.apiary.io))

I've been as well involved in multiple parts of the application, including **payment infrastructure**, **team
management**, as well as part of the team that crafted the first **microservice** and the initial 
[Swagger support in Apiary](https://blog.apiary.io/2016/01/18/We-ve-got-Swagger) - then my focus has been
entirely on the **Documentation** application

During the journey, I had my chances to contribute multiple times back in several open source projects,
as well as create totally new ones for our purposes, among these: **create-react-app**, **Visual Studio Code**,
**Emscritpen** and so on.

I've developed a [Visual Studio Code Extension](https://github.com/XVincentX/vscode-apielements) that's been claimed
as the best editor experience for API Blueprint and Swagger.

I've kicked off and created multiple key features for the product, such as the **MSON** rendering via the [Attributes Kit](https://github.com/apiaryio/attributes-kit) as well as the [Console Proxy](https://github.com/apiaryio/console-proxy).
I'm also author of some [documentation pages](https://help.apiary.io/tools/browser-jsagent/) for the product.

While most of the code was **CoffeScript**, we slowly moved to **ES6** for all new libraries.
While most of frontend code is still a **Backbone** application, we're slowly moving to React.

During the journey, I gained a good experience in the whole NodeJS applications ecosystem and the
SaaS product.

Fun fact: According to Github, I've been the third most prolific contributor to the codebase of all the times, although I just joined in **Oct 2014**. If we count the contributions since the time I joined, I'm the number one.

### [Nettuno Solutions](http://www.nettunosolutions.com)
#### Software division of Fire SPA
##### Software developer - **Sept 2013 - Dec 2014**

In charge of **Recuper@**, debt management software used by banks and similar companies
(some customers: **Deutsche Bank**, **Banca Popolare di Milano**, **Fire**, **Gextra**).

It is a _Silverlight 5_ application with a **WCF backend**, started in 2008.

I've been involved in the application mantainance as well as introducing new features.

In particular, I was part of the small team planning a major technological update as migrating
_NHibernate_ to **EntityFramework**, _WCF_ to **WebApi** based on Owin Middleware,
_Silverlight_ to **HTML**, _Unity_ to **AutoFac**.

The team was about 13 developers, **cloc** says we're about 330k lines of code.

### [Webspaces SRL](http://www.webspaces.it)
#### Software development, Internet Service Provider and Voip Telephony
##### Cofounder - **Nov 2013 - May 2014**

In November 2013, we made sense of our hardware and technology stack was getting old.
We were not able to answer quickly and efficiently to customer requests anymore.

For this reason, we started a modernization of all our infrastructure and software.

At first, we have completely dismantled our server farm and migrated everything to **Microsoft Azure**
platform, using IaaS (Asterisk PBX on CentOS). We refreshed **Asterisk** installation to the latest version,
and rewrote from scratch some services directly taking advantage of new Asterisk REST API instead of
old **AMI interface**.

A second server, with **IIS and Radius** service has been replaced by **Azure WebSites**,
Active Directory authentication, while all WebApi for phone application have been
replaced with Azure Mobile Services (some with NodeJS, some with .NET backend).

Now we have less costs, more services, less pollution, less worries...and an empty room.

I've been contributing to other open source projects back in the time when Github wasn't main stream

- Contributor for **eAthena** project, (open source Ragnarok server emulator) where I made a complete rewriting of memory manager to achieve better performance.

It has been killed due to Italians carriers coalition against me (I've been sued), and then I open sourced it. [Some notes are here](/building-siminfo/)
