I'm really happy to announce today that **vscode-apielements**, a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
is able to parse [Swagger](https://swagger.io) documents starting from version 0.3.0!

You can find the extension in the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vncz.vscode-apielements).

This was not the only thing introduced in this version. There's a plenty of other stuff you might be interested by looking
at the [changelog](https://github.com/XVincentX/vscode-apielements/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) page.

There's a lot more going on - stay tuned on that!
