I've joined [Apiary](https://www.apiary.io) as software developer.

#### What is Apiary? 

Apiary is a SaaS that supercharges your [APIBlueprints](http://apiblueprint.org) with interactive documentation, API mock, test suites, validations, traffic inspector and collaboration.

> Apiary is the GitHub for APIs.

### Why?

These guys are building amazing stuff and promoting a completely new way to build software: **A**pi **D**riven **D**evelopment. You can find bunch of information [just](http://www.codegent.com/blog/2013/8/the-value-of-api-driven-development) [googling](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/api-driven-development) [around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccqGOODoQTg), and I am really proud to join into such kind of company.

### What are you going to do as a "Software Developer"?

Apiary is not just Apiary.io platform. You can realize it just having a quick look at out [Github repository](https://github.com/apiaryio/) and see how many project are there that currently are powering Apiary.io platform. That is just 10% of what we want to do. We're planning a lot of amazing stuff for you.

### Are you leaving enterprise experiences?

I really hope that, forever. Enterprise companies have really few in common with software development, at least in my experiences. Stop working for a customer focused company to a _developer_ focused one was one of my career step that I am finally making. I really hope I will not deal with **fake** enterprise anymore. I'll try to share more about the Italian enterprise acceptation.

### Are you leaving .NET ecosystem as well?

Absolutely **NOT**. While .NET stack is a bit far from actual technology in Apiary, I like to write about myself as
> nodeJS developer by day, .NET addicted by night. Or viceversa.

API are API and not language depending. Tooling is, and this is a very interesting field where I would like to continue to work on. .NET developers are a huge part of the market and it is going to be expanded due to recent opensourcing of **dotnetfxcore**. I'll do my best to bring (or at least, propose to bring!) all Apiary tools into the amazing Visual Studio suite.

### Are you moving?

Definitely yes! I have accepted to relocate in Prague. However, Apiary is present in San Francisco too, and I can't wait until my first job trip.
