I'm really happy to announce today the first release of **vscode-apielements**, a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) extension whose aim is to make your life easier when working with [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org) and [Swagger](https://swagger.io) documents.

I have been developing this extension for fun during my spare time in order to understand the model behind Visual Studio Code.

I am so happy that the thing evolved in a way that now is almost a fully working extension, on whose I count to work on it almost continuously.

## Supported features

1. Syntax highlight
2. Parser error and warnings
3. Useful snippets
4. Basic symbol navigation (CMD + @)
5. Best parser selection

Those are a good starting point; you can find a detailed explanation as well a small roadmap on Github project page.

The code, as I just said, has been released on [Github](https://github.com/XVincentX/vscode-apielements), but you can download the extension directly in your VSCode installation looking for `vscode-apielements`.

There's also a very nice link on their [marketplace page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vncz.vscode-apielements)

I'd like to thank Apiary for the tools which made this possible.
