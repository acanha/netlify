On 25-29 October I spoke at [FullStack](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6612-fullstack#program) conference, about callbacks and promises. Here is the [video link](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6774-api-blueprint-for-api-design-lifecycle)!

APIs are software and as such they are a target of the basic software engineering rules we are all taught for decades. Unfortunately, this fact is often ignored or forgotten, and the common API design process resembles the infamous waterfall model. As APIs are often sitting on boundaries between groups of developers with very different expectations and use cases, problems resulting from one-sided waterfall development are even worse than usual.

I tried to show you how to avoid waterfalls by employing iterations, prototyping, communication with client developers, and testing using API Blueprint, an opensource markdown-based WebApi language designed for humans and understandable by machines.

Unfortunately a registration is required in order to see the video, but I really think that is worth of.

I hope you will enjoy it!

Cheers!
